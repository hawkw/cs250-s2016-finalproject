/** ==Edge-Weighted Graphs==
  *
  * In an edge-weighted graph, each edge is associated with a weight. These
  * weights can be any type which is an instance of `Numeric`. This class is
  * specialised over `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double`, but you can use
  * anything that has an associated implementation of `Numeric`.
  *
  * The shortest paths between nodes in an edge-weighted graph are found
  * based on the weight of the edges traversed, not by the number of edges in
  * the path.
