/** Trait for a measure on a [[FingerTree]].
  *
  * A measure on a [[FingerTree]] is essentially a `Monoid`.
  *
  * A monoid is a semigroup with an identity. A monoid is a specialization of a
  * semigroup, so its operation must be associative. Additionally,
  * `combine(x, empty) == combine(empty, x) == x`.
  *
  * @todo Can this just be represented with a `Monoid` from `cats`?
  *
  * Right now we are essentially writing our own `Monoid` typeclass so as to
  * avoid using an external library. It might be better to just depend on
  * either `scalaz` or `algebra` (I think `algebra` looks nicer but it's also
  * experimental) to get `Monoid`s.
  *
  * Created by hawk on 3/14/16.
